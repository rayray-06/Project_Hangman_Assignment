# Project_Hangman_Assignment
This is a repo for our hangman project made up of a team of three. Rayyan, Maleeha and Bridget 
## Project overview
Our group has chosen to create an engaging, fun mobile version of the game Hangman. The idea is the classic game but adapted into an app with a touchscreen layout so that it can be used easily on a phone. The target audience for this application is teenagers and young adults aged 13–20, as this age group is a good fit for our game because they generally enjoy quick, casual and even competitive games anywhere, whether that be in class, on the bus or at home.
## Project specification 
The overall aim of this project is to make a siple and engaging mobile version of the classic hangman game aimed at users aged 13-20. The app will allow for players to guess letters using on screen buttons with each guess revealing the correct letters in the word, or reduce the number of attempts that remain. The multiplayer aspect of our game will let two players participate together through different devices. The first player needs to generate a room with a brief code which enables the second player to enter the room through their own device. The two devices will share the same game state through an online database system which shows letter guesses in real-time to both players. The design keeps the game basic while allowing two players to play together without sharing a single device.The app provides immediate feedback to players when they choose an incorrect answer. The game will show a basic results screen after players finish the word or use up all their attempts. The development of this application will use Python together with a mobile-friendly framework. This includes Kivy as a potential option. The project files will be stored and managed through GitHub.
## Target audience 
The project aims to serve young adults together with teenagers who fall within the age range of 13 to 20 years. A mobile Hangman game would suit this age group perfectly because they tend to enjoy quick and simple games that need no complex controls or extended instructions. Most people in this range already know how Hangman works, so the rules are very quick to understand.
