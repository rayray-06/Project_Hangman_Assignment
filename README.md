# Project_Hangman_Assignment
This is a repo for our hangman project made up of a team of three. Rayyan, Maleeha and Bridget 
## Project overview
Our group has chosen to create an engaging, fun mobile version of the game hangman. The idea is the classic game but adapted into an app with a touchscreen layout so that it can be used easily on a phone. The target audiance for this application is teenagers and young adults aged 13-20 as this age group is a good fit for our game because they genrally enjoy quick, casual and even competitive games anywhere, whether that be in class, on the bus or at home. 
## Project specification 
The overall aim of this project is to make a siple and engaging mobile version of the classic hangman game aimed at users aged 13-20. The app will allow for players to guess letters using on screen buttons with each guess revealing the correct letters in the word, or reduce the number of attempts that remain. For the mutiplayer aspect One player can guess the word for the other player or have a random word generated. When a player makes an incorrect guess the app will let them know they are wrong. Once a word is completed or there are no more remaining attempts, the game will display a simple results screen. This application will be developed with Python and a mobile freindly framework eg.Kivy (not decided yet) with the project being stored and managed through Github.
