# Project_Hangman_Assignment
This is a repo for our hangman project made up of a team of three. Rayyan, Maleeha and Bridget 
## Project overview
The overall aim for this project is to create an engaging, fun mobile version of the game hangman. The idea is the classic game but adapted into an app with a touchscreen layout so that it can be used easily on a phone. The target audiance for this application is teenagers and young adults aged 13-20 as this age group is a good fit for our game because they genrally enjoy quick, casual and even competitive games anywhere, wther that be in class, on the bus or at home.
